# aerial-search-and-find
a search algorithm that can be loaded into a flight controller to find missing item(s).

The fundamental concept behind this endevour is to build a simple program that can download a set of coordinates (longitude, latitude and elevation) to a flight controller installed in an aerial vehicle that can initiate a search and find pattern in space.

The program will have to plot waypoints in Google Earth so that operators can preplot actual search patterns.

There has to be a way to update the code to incorporate improved search algorithms as they may be developed by Coast Guard organisations around the world.
Code must incorporate the ability to compute new waypoints "on the fly" driven by environmenatl parameters such as tides, currents and wind vectors.

The whole system has to be transportable, quickly implemented and intuitive.

The code will need to be able to be run from computers, iPads, iPhones and/or Android equivalents.

There will be more to come as I think about it in the future.
